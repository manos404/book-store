# Book-store

This project was created as part of the Udemy course **"[NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide)"** by **Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller**.

The main purpose of this project is to practice and learn modern web development techniques and tools.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Work In Progress**  
This project is not yet complete. The current version includes basic functionality and serves as a learning tool to explore new technologies. Updates and additional features will be added as I continue to work on it.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Architecture**: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **Template Engine**: EJS

## Purpose of the Project

This project was built to:
- Practice implementing the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture in Node.js.
- Learn how to use **template engines (EJS)** for rendering dynamic HTML content on the server side.
- Understand the flow of a full-stack application from database to frontend.
- Gain hands-on experience with modern development tools and techniques.

## Current Features

- Basic CRUD functionality for managing books (partial implementation).
- Dynamic HTML rendering using EJS templates.
- Initial setup of the MVC architecture for better code organization.


## What I Learned So Far

Through this project, I have gained experience in:
- Designing and implementing the **MVC architecture** for better code organization and maintainability.
- Working with **EJS template engines** to create reusable and dynamic components.
